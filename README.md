ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Nicholas Guilbeault, a versatile software engineer with a passion for building technologies through problem-solving, continuous learning, and writing clean, interpretable code. My background in **systems neuroscience** and **data analysis**, along with my expertise in **C#**, **Python**, and **machine learning** drive my curiosity to explore new ideas and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact on the community.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m the lead contributor to the [Bonsai.ML open-source machine learning repository](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/machinelearning), integrating powerful ML capabilities into the Bonsai reactive programming ecosystem. My expertise expands to different programming languages, such as **R**, **Julia**, and **JavaScript**, while continuing to explore domains such as **high-performance computing**, **distributed systems**, and **cloud computing**. Whether through open-source contributions or crafting robust applications, I thrive on tackling complex challenges.

ðŸ“š Outside of coding, I'm often diving deep into the latest industry trends, sifting through internet archives, or experimenting with cutting-edge tools and frameworks to stay ahead of the curve.

ðŸŒ± Always eager to collaborate. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
