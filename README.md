ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Nicholas Guilbeault, a versatile software engineer with a passion for building, problem-solving, continuous learning, and writing clean, interpretable code. Currently, Iâ€™m a **Research Software Engineer** in the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit), where I work closely with neuroscientists at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) to build research tools in computational neuroscience and machine learning.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m also the lead contributor to the [Bonsai.ML open-source machine learning repository](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/machinelearning), integrating powerful ML capabilities into the Bonsai reactive programming ecosystem. My background in **systems neuroscience** and strong computational skills in **C#**, **Python**, **Bonsai**, and **machine learning** drive my curiosity to explore new ideas and contribute to meaningful projects. I'm always expanding and refining my expertise by exploring new programming languages like **JavaScript**, **Julia**, and **R**, and deepening my knowledge in **high-performance computing**, **distributed systems**, and **cloud computing** to tackle complex computational problems.

ðŸ“š Outside of coding, I'm often diving deep into the latest technology trends, sifting through internet archives, or experimenting with new tools and frameworks.

ðŸŒ± I'm always eager to collaborate. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
