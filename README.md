ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Nicholas Guilbeault, a software engineer with a passion for building. Currently, Iâ€™m a **Research Software Engineer** at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) working closely with researchers at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) and beyond to build tools in computational neuroscience and machine learning.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m the lead developer of the [Bonsai.ML project](https://bonsai-rx.org/machinelearning/) and contributor to the [open-source repository](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/machinelearning), integrating powerful ML functionality into the [Bonsai-Rx](https://bonsai-rx.org/) visual reactive programming language.

ðŸ“š Outside of coding, I'm often diving deep into the latest technology trends, sifting through internet archives, or experimenting with new tools and frameworks.

ðŸŒ± I'm always eager to collaborate. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
